			<p><b>I saw a player with a yellow username. What does the color mean?</b></p>
			<p>This player is a game administrator. Only administrators can get yellow names.</p>
			<p><b>How do I change my username?</b></p>
			<p>Please contact an administrator. If you were taken here from the username bug, please take in mind that setting a new name will create a new object and your account data might be lost. Contact us to allow you to safely change your name.</p>
			<p><b>How do I get more worlds?</b></p>
			<p>You have 26 worlds, 4 of each type, which is more than enough. We may only give extra worlds (which won't appear in your world list) on special circumstances.</p>
