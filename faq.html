			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<p><b>Why does the game ask me to install Adobe Flash Player?</b></p>
			<p>EE CM is a Shockwave Flash application, thus you need Adobe Flash Player in order to run the game. If you already have Adobe Flash Player installed, then it may be out of date or not working properly. Try using another browser.</p>
			<p><b>Why is the game stuck at a black screen?</b></p>
			<p>The game did not load properly because of internet troubles, or there are issues with your Adobe Flash Player. Try refreshing the page, or using another browser.</p>
			<p><b>I got an horrible error when loading the game. What does this mean?</b></p>
			<p>These errors mean that the game failed to connect to the server. These errors may usually happen because of your internet connection, but servers may also be unavailable, or you're possibly using an out-dated client.</p>
			<p><b>I was kicked from a world because data from my client was not correct. Why?</b></p>
			<p>You were kicked by the anti-cheat system, that prevents players from making unfair movements. If you're using the normal client, then the anti-cheat system may have kicked you because of packet loss, as it will think you're skipping movements.</p>
			<p><b>Game said I am creating traffic. What does it mean?</b></p>
			<p>You're trying to join worlds too fast. Please wait 10 seconds after you've joined a world, to join other.</p>
			<p><b>Why can't I join a world? / Why does the game throw me back to the lobby with no message?</b></p>
			<p>You have been disconnected of the world. This may be caused by lag or big activity on worlds. You could also have accidentally pressed the "Go to lobby" button.</p>
